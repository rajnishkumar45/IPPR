Aim: To perform Hough transform on a given image

The image is first converted into binary form and then put into Hough transform, and the region with the highest frequency is marked on the graph.

Program:

I = imread("C:\Users\RAJNISH SARKAR\Desktop\pp.jpg");
imshow(I)
title('original image')
figure
I =im2bw(double(I),0.5);
[y,x]=find(I);
[sy,sx]=size(I);
imshow(I);
title('binary image')
figure
totalpix = length(x);
HM = zeros(sy,sx);
R = 34;
R2 = R^2;
b = 1:sy;
for cnt = 1:totalpix
a = (round(x(cnt) - sqrt(R2 - (y(cnt) - [1:sy]).^2)));
for cnt2 =1:sy
if isreal(a(cnt2),0) & real(a(cnt2))>0
HM(cnt2,real(a(cnt2))) = HM(cnt2,real(a(cnt2))) + 1;
end
end
end
[maxval, maxind] = max(max(HM));
[B,A] = find(HM==maxval);
imshow(double(I));
title('Hough transform')
figure
mtlb_hold on;
plot(mean(A),sy-mean(B),'rx');


Result: Hough transform has been successfully implemented for the given image.
